      <h2>About the Book :</h2>
      <p>
        It tells the story of House Targaryen, a powerful family of dragonlords,
        nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. <br />

        The main conflict arises between Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, the chosen
        heir of King Viserys I, and Prince Aegon II, his son from another
        marriage. <br />

        After Viserys I dies, both claim the throne, leading to a brutal war of
        succession. <br />

        The civil war causes dragons to turn against each other, leading to
        massive destruction and eventually the downfall of the Targaryen
        dragon-riding dominance.
